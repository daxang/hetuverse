# Creative sections

Hetu designs and builds two independent sections within it: monkey and typewriter experiment, and Virtual Library of Hetuverse, in addition to offering creative assistance to the majority of creators and encouraging them to build their microcosms. These two sections on Hetu as innovative ideas for researching and exploring the future Web3 collective work and project linkage, hoping to provide diversified inspiration for the future creator ecosystem.
