# Monkey and Typewriter Experiment

If countless monkeys hitting keys at random on countless typewriter keyboards for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type the complete works of William Shakespeare.

We hope to verify the artistic creativity of collective consciousness through a decentralized creative experiment on our platform. All the writers and readers of Hetu will be invited to co-create the next series of novels, and an elimination mechanism will ensure the works' quality.

In the future, the monkey and typewriter will become a non-stop novel writer composed of millions of authors and readers, producing and creating for the Virtual Library of Hetuverse.
