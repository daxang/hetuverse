# The supreme decision-making power of Creative Content Rights Distribution

This right is known as the "right to own". Creators do not have the right to bargain in the web2 or traditional publishing industries. Once a creator's work gets marketed, a considerable portion of their rights and interests will unavoidably be distributed. In the age of algorithms, many creators have to give up their names in order to get market support from cultural enterpriseï¼›

Through a new decentralized content ecosystem, Hetu intends to provide creators with a more advantageous business position and more dimensions of marketization, assisting creators in obtaining more revenue and maintaining themselves in a higher level with more confidence and assurance. We believe that a creator who has a more secure income will produce more engaging works.
