# The freedom to create content from your heart

Creators on Hetuverse should be allowed to produce any material they want or are willing to generate based on their own hearts and share it with the rest of the world. No one in the Hetuverse will compel creators to generate content in accordance with capital and market demands with their set direction and subject matter. Every artist should freely express their ideas and creativity without limits and self-restraint. Don't let the impurities of web2 and traditional cultural industries continue to imprison the really valuable things in your mind.&#x20;

Some argue that if people's imaginations are unrestricted, they would produce endless rubbish, even things that hurt society. for this, we should use the words that Milton said in 17th century:

What wisdom can there be to choose, what continence to forbear without the knowledge of evil? â€” Milton
