# Super Market

Because creativity is limitless, the future Hetu platform will be a "sea of content" that accommodates thousands of cultural IPs. Every IP and every work in it will be set up with license agreements by the creator in advance when it is released. We welcome and encourage all individuals, companies, and other entities to use Hetu to search for and directly purchase IP works that meet their needs.

Due to smart contracts, commercial authorization, which is inefficient in the traditional cultural industry, will become incredibly efficient on Hetu. Searching for creative IP is no longer a barrier or a constraint because of the platform's high degree of openness. Each participating entity has the right to access any creator's work.

In Hetu, purchasing cultural and creative IPs will be a complete bidding process instead of a monopoly problem.

As a result, we refer to it as a supermarket.
