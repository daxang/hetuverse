# Commercial Compound Interest

Creators can write commercial rights in their own works using the Hetu platform's smart contract, allowing them to be purchased and used independently by all users and automatically providing them with commercial compound interest revenue. Creators can earn money from their work if it is shared, traded, or used commercially. There's no need for lawyers or a marketing team.
