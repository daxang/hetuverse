# Build your own community, discover and gather True fans

In the field of traditional cultural creation, including the web2 creation platform, creators succumb to capital strength under difficult conditions, primarily because they are unable to bring their works to market through their own efforts and manage a fine market promotion, which to harvest the benefits that meet their expectations.

But what is exciting is that even in the era of web2, we are beginning to see that more and more creators, particularly content creators, are gradually using certain ways or small platforms to gather their loyal fan groups, maintain and develop their own content through the operation of fan community.

The fan community has great significance to those who aspire to engage in high-quality creations full-time. The most enlightening article on this subject is the one by Kevin Kelly's 1,000 True Fans, which is a classic worthy of repeated reading for all creators around the world. In crypto era, Lijin extended Kevin Kelly's theory based on her own observations and analysis. She believes that as long as there are 100 real fans, it can support a creator to achieve full-hearted creative devotion.

In a decentralized platform, we believe that helping creators achieve economic benefits and building a loyal fan community are the two most effective ways.
