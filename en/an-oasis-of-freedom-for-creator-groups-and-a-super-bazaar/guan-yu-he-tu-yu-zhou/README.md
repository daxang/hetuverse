# Multiple basic income guarantees for Creators

Hetu will strive to establish multiple market-based rewarding ways, so creators can get more basic income and create things without financial burden.

Hetu offers creators a variety of income assurances, including the following:

Creator token: Creators can issue their own creator tokens based on themselves or part and overall of their work. Creators can airdrop creator tokens to their fan group or issue a public sell. Of course, we don't want creator tokens to exist solely as meme tokens, but rather as a reflection of the creator's personal charm and the creator's content worth.

NFT: Creators can swiftly and inexpensively publish their work in the form of NFT and distribute it via airdrops, pre-sale, public sale, and other methods. Creators hold full benefits from these methods.

Paywall: Just like the traditional web2 content sales method, creators can also choose this method to sell their own works. In Hetu, creators could set up a paywall with some tokens. The token categories include cryptocurrency, stable currency, creator tokens, etc. The creators can customize the specific sales form, such as charging by chapters of content or by subscription time.

Hetu's multiple basic income functions are listed above, and more may be added in the future. In terms of platform fees, we can affirm that there are no plans to charge creators for service fees or handling fees.
