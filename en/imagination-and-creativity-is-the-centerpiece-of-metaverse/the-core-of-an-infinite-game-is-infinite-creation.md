# The core of an infinite game is infinite creation

As Yuval Harari said, whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe–is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination.

&#x20;

From a civilizational point of view, primitive imaginations in terms of mythology, theology and religion helped humans move from tribes to slavery and feudalism. Improvements in religious interpretation have produced new narrative scenarios, resulting in the formation of a power-balancing framework. It is undeniable that imagination is a primary motive power driving technological advancement from a scientific standpoint.

&#x20;

The most intuitive example is why we talk about the concept of Metaverse today because of a novel called "Snow Crash" written by Neal Stephenson. Stephenson mentioned an extremely vast and free country: Cyber Space, a virtual space composed of computers and networks in the novel. To most people, this concept seems like just appreared yesterday on reddit or 4chan, but in fact, this novel was published in 1992, right after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Well, maybe someone doesn't even know what the Soviet Union is.

&#x20;

A concept created by imagination 30 years ago has become the pursuit direction of human civilization progress today, leading countless of the world's most talented scientific and technological individuals and Internet talents to rush into it. In a civilized sense, Stephenson's story is probably as great as the first myth created on the plains of Mesopotamia 5000 years ago.

&#x20;

While Metaverse, like big bang from the singularity, is expanding at an infinite speed. Now its space is exceedingly large, yet its vitality is extremely desolate. Every corner urgently needs imagination to fill, to immigrate, to build, to grow flowers out of the void.

&#x20;

According to our limited understanding, Metaverse is a higher-dimensional, more ecological, humanistic, and free civilisation. Its production, whether it is the concept of content ecology or the discovery and deployment of technology means, need the long-term participation of a large-scale, innovative, and creative community.

&#x20;

We need Stephenson to shape the galaxy, Liu Cixin to formulate the rules of dark forest, Ted Jiang to create alien races and languages, and Cameron and Scott to render the storyliness. It also includes people who have brilliant minds but are still unknown. You and I, as well as him, are among them.

&#x20;

It's an infinite world, and we're going to play an infinite game. In the past history, what we have participated in is a limited game with a limited number of people,in limited time and limited space, but this time, we have entered a level of ∞ in all aspects.

&#x20;

The core of this infinite game is infinite imagination and creation. We need every bit of imagination in every corner of the world, no matter how big or small, real or virtual, no matter who it comes from, to nurture Metaverse, keep it evolving and growing, until human civilization perishes and the universe restarts.
