# Metaverse Is Desperate For Great Stories

Metaverse is now a meme for the society: everyone talks about it, everyone knows about it, everyone is working on Metaverse startup projects, but in fact, no one seems to really understand what it is. Honestly, we don't know either.

&#x20;

But, we are relatively certain of two things:&#x20;

1\. Metaverse will be more than a game or a giant virtual application. Any such way of interpretation is a dimensionality reduction to it.

2\. no matter on building, developing, exploring and playing in it, Metaverse will always require fantastic stories as its source of evolution.
