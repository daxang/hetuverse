# Hetu NFT

Note: We are seriously considering whether to make Gold Collector NFT as official Hetu NFT.but undoubtedly, Gold Collector NFT indeed will perform an essential role in Hetu.

How Hetu NFT created: 1.users (creators) can mint a Hetu NFT through publishing original works 2. Platform users (readers) can mint a Hetu NFT through mining content or successfully promoting platform content 3. Hetu will give away Hetu NFTs to specialists outside for encouraging them to participate in the content and market ecology of Hetu.

The supply of Hetu NFT is unlimited. As a governance tool with the following characteristics:

1\. According to the user roles, there are creator NFT, community contributor NFT and miner NFT. Each NFT has different authority on different governance issues. For example, "creator NFT" outweighs "contributor NFT" in terms of voting in development of platform creation function.

2\. Hetu NFT has the characteristics of being composable. It will continuously upgrade itself with the continuous participation of the holder in the platform and continuously superimpose the corresponding governance rights . For example, the "contributor NFT" is only one lowest level NFT after the initial mint but can be continuously leveled up through non-stop contribution to the community. If community contributors exert some content minings, they can also grant their NFTs governance rights in content mining;

3\. Hetu invites outsiders to participate in community construction directly by giving them the corresponding NFTs, which are already granted specific governance rights (it will be decided through community voting, everything is open and transparent).

Hetu NFT holders have the highest governance right in platform construction and governance. We also hope that in this way, the ownership of Hetu will be given back to those people who contribute, genuinely love and need this platform, instead of phony Web3 users who intend to overtake everything with capital.

Hetu NFT can be traded. But if it is transferred to an address that does not have any contribution in Hetu, even if the address holds a high-level Hetu NFT, it will not have the right to govern and participate.
