# Credit

Using Hetu, you get Credits. Users create and publish works, produce NFT, read books, promote works, content mining, etc... Each behavior will generate a certain amount of credit rewards;

&#x20;Credit is a one user's behavioral score, not a cryptocurrency. This point will be connected with HTT and Hetu NFT and mainly reflect the user's participation in the platform. For example, based on the number of new credits collected by one user, the platform will regularly airdrop certain HTTs to the user as a behavior incentive.

&#x20;Credits cannot be transferred or traded. Other benefits that users with more credits may receive:

· NFT or poaps that are officially issued by the platform alone or jointly with creators;

· Invitations to join creators’ communities;

· Getting access to the original creation, newly released original content;

· NFTs or whitelists of creator token;

· Irregular airdrops of NFT or creator token;

· Certain platform revenue dividends.
