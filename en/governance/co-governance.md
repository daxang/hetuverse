# co-governance

Before the launch of Hetu NFT and HTT, it is mainly the founding team that makes all the decisions on the development of Hetu. After the launch of two primary governance tools, we can adopt a co-governance approach. It means the founding team mainly decides the aspects of the platform's technique, function and operation. The community is mainly responsible for using funds and the distribution of rights and dividends.
